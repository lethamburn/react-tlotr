        <strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong> is an epic high-fantasy novel by English author
        and scholar <strong>J. R. R. Tolkien</strong>. Set in Middle-earth, intended to be Earth
        at some time in the distant past, the story began as a sequel to
        Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit, but eventually developed into
        a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, <strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong> is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150
        million copies sold. The title refers to the story's main antagonist,
        the Dark Lord Sauron, who in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule
        the other Rings of Power given to Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in his
        campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the
        Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the story
        ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring
        mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin.
